How to compile:
    - navigate to PermissionsFix source directory
    - type: "ant dist"
    - when compiling is done all needed files are located in ant-dist directory
    - you can specify options "-Ddocdist=1" and/or "-Dtestdist=1" if you wish
      to place docs and/or test files to ant-dist directory
    - you can run "ant run-test" to run test suits (you need junit4 for this)
